Coding standards of this project

General principles

1. reliability (including numerical stability)
2. accuracy
3. performance

Modularity

1. The code should be sorted into meaningful files and functions/subroutines as long as it does not harm performance.
2. Sort files into meaningful directories.

Blank spaces

1. Never use more than one blank line.
2. Don't use tabs.
3. Use two blank spaces for indentations.
4. Don't use blank spaces behind commas.
5. In formulas, blank spaces should be inserted where it helps the eye, but not behind every symbol and/or number.

Names

1. Use underscores: new_variable.
2. Do not use capitals inside names: ThisIsForbidden, thisIsForbidden.
3. Use names that explain the meaning of the named object.

Comments

Do not use too much comments (<< 50 % of the code should be comments).
Explain only those things that somebody who is reading your code for the first time would need to know.
